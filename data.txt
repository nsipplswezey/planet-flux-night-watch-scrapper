[{"title":"1000-year flood, South Carolina","description":"Severe flooding followed record-breaking rains in South Carolina in early October 2015. More than a dozen dams were breached, entire neighborhoods were swamped, hundreds of roads were made impassable and more than a dozen people were killed. Meteorologists classified the event as a “1000-year rain,” meaning that the probability of a rainstorm this heavy occurring in any given year is only 0.1 percent. The dark areas visible in the 2014 image, shown for comparison, are cloud shadows.","googleLatLon":"https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=34.00071,-81.034814&z=3&t=p&hl=en&gl=US&mapclient=apiv3","miniMap":"http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js/StaticMapService.GetMapImage?1m2&1i443&2i744&2e2&3u3&4m2&1u240&2u148&5m5&1e4&5sen&6sus&10b1&12b1&token=40301","credit":"Images taken by the Operational Land Imager onboard Landsat 8 and the Advanced Land Imager onboard NASA’s Earth Observing-1 satellite.

Less than three decades later, its cities have ballooned and merged into an interconnected megalopolis. Its population quadrupled from 10 million to 42 million, larger than that of Australia, Argentina or Canada. If considered one entity, the Pearl River Delta region has overtaken Tokyo as the world’s largest urban area by size and population, according to the World Bank. In these images, rural areas—mainly farmland and forest—appear green. Urban areas are gray and white.","googleLatLon":"https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=22.5333,113.7333&z=3&t=p&hl=en&gl=US&mapclient=apiv3","miniMap":"http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js/StaticMapService.GetMapImage?1m2&1i1551&2i818&2e2&3u3&4m2&1u240&2u148&5m5&1e4&5sen&6sus&10b1&12b1&token=36360","credit":"Credit: Images taken by the Thematic Mapper sensor onboard Landsat 5 and the Operational Land Imager onboard Landsat 8.

These images were taken one week before, two months after and 10 years after the storm. Normal vegetation appears bright green, flood-damaged vegetation is brown and water is dark blue. Katrina delivered a massive surge of water that dramatically enlarged lakes, including Lake Lery and Petit Lake. It also scoured new channels and widened canals in ways that eliminated large amounts of marshland. As seen in the 2015 image, flood-damaged vegetation has returned to its normal color, but the enlarged waterways have persisted.","googleLatLon":"https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=29.951066,-90.071532&z=3&t=p&hl=en&gl=US&mapclient=apiv3","miniMap":"http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js/StaticMapService.GetMapImage?1m2&1i392&2i771&2e2&3u3&4m2&1u240&2u148&5m5&1e4&5sen&6sus&10b1&12b1&token=129007","credit":"Images taken by the Thematic Mapper sensor onboard Landsat 5 and the Operational Land Imager onboard Landsat 8.
