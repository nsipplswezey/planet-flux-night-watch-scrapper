More than a dozen dams were breached, entire neighborhoods were swamped, hundreds of roads were made impassable and more than a dozen people were killed. Meteorologists classified the event as a “1000-year rain,” meaning that the probability of a rainstorm this heavy occurring in any given year is only 0.1 percent. The dark areas visible in the 2014 image, shown for comparison, are cloud shadows.","googleLatLon":"https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=34.00071,-81.034814&z=3&t=p&hl=en&gl=US&mapclient=apiv3","miniMap":"http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js/StaticMapService.GetMapImage?1m2&1i443&2i744&2e2&3u3&4m2&1u240&2u148&5m5&1e4&5sen&6sus&10b1&12b1&token=67649","credit":"Images taken by the Operational Land Imager onboard Landsat 8 and the Advanced Land Imager onboard NASA’s Earth Observing-1 satellite.

It is an important illustration of how the advance and retreat of certain glaciers are controlled more by calving mechanics than by climate changes. In 2002, Hubbard pushed forward and sealed off Russell Fjord from Disenchantment Bay, turning the fjord into a lake. On August 14th of that year, the lake burst through the ice dam with a one-hour peak discharge of 54,000 cubic meters (1.9 million cubic feet) of water per second — the second-largest measured glacial lake outburst worldwide.

Left: June 6, 1987. Right: June 8, 2011. More than half of the U.S.' electrical power comes from coal burning and a large percentage of that coal comes from West Virginia. Of the nearly 150 million tons of coal extracted each year from the state's mines, an increasing amount (60 million tons in 2009) comes from surface mining and mountaintop removal. Mountaintop removal can have serious impacts on the health of local people — through the pollution of groundwater by mine runoff and exposure to airborne toxins and dust — and on the environment — through permanent loss of critical ecosystems, destruction of forests and loss of streams. Scientific evidence suggests that these impacts are pervasive and irreversible and that efforts to reclaim the disturbed land can't make up for the impacts felt by the mining process.","googleLatLon":"https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=38.597626,-80.454903&z=3&t=p&hl=en&gl=US&mapclient=apiv3","miniMap":"http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js/StaticMapService.GetMapImage?1m2&1i446&2i712&2e2&3u3&4m2&1u240&2u148&5m5&1e4&5sen&6sus&10b1&12b1&token=108340","credit":"Images taken by the Thematic Mapper sensor onboard Landsat 5.

Use of water drawn from deep wells in the aquifer has increased tenfold since 1960, with a corresponding growth in agriculture. But some studies suggest that the planned rate of extraction is unsustainable and will lead to local depressions in the water table, making the precious liquid more and more expensive to access.","googleLatLon":"https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=25.274313,28.795812&z=3&t=p&hl=en&gl=US&mapclient=apiv3","miniMap":"http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js/StaticMapService.GetMapImage?1m2&1i1068&2i801&2e2&3u3&4m2&1u240&2u148&5m5&1e4&5sen&6sus&10b1&12b1&token=75776","credit":"Source: United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).

One of the main reasons is crop irrigation: water has been drawn off from the rivers that kept the Aral Sea filled. As the sea has shrunk, there have been noticeable changes in the local climate, contaminated dust storms, and the loss of drinking water and the local fishing industry. By the late 2000s, the Aral Sea had lost four fifths of its water volume.","googleLatLon":"https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=45.111904,60.623951&z=3&t=p&hl=en&gl=US&mapclient=apiv3","miniMap":"http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js/StaticMapService.GetMapImage?1m2&1i1446&2i918&2e2&3u3&4m2&1u240&2u148&5m5&1e4&5sen&6sus&10b1&12b1&token=102186","credit":"Images taken by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA's Terra satellite.
